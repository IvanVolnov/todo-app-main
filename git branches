[31m-## Where to find everything[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. [m
[31m-[m
[31m-The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. [m
[31m-[m
[31m-If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Building your project[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).[m
[31m-2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.[m
[31m-3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.[m
[31m-4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.[m
[31m-5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.[m
[31m-6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Deploying your project[m
[31m-[m
[31m-As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)[m
[31m-- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)[m
[31m-- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Create a custom `README.md`[m
[31m-[m
[31m-We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Submitting your solution[m

[31m-Remember, if you're looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are with your questions, the higher the chance you'll get valuable feedback from the community.[m
